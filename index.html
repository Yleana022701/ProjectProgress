 <p style="background-color:rgba(133, 82,141, 0.2);color:white;"> There's a couple of tasks that needed to be completed. We've been thinking about what we're going to use and what we're going to do with this project. We also plan on the layout or the placement of the components. One of the components we need for this project is not yet available and our manuscript continues to be worked on. We've still got to try and test our project.</p>
